In recent years, computer science has seen a surge in using visual elements, especially images, in research articles. These visuals play a vital role in conveying complex ideas, presenting data, and enhancing the clarity of scholarly work. Simultaneously, gender dynamics have gained attention across academic disciplines, aiming to uncover hidden biases. The convergence of these realms—visual analysis and gender studies—provides a unique lens to explore gender differences within images in scientific articles.
This research conducts an in-depth analysis of images appearing in scholarly articles across diverse topics and evolves over time. By harnessing advanced computer vision techniques and data mining methodologies, we aim to discern patterns and trends of gender within these images. Furthermore, we endeavor to identify how these visual representations evolve in accordance with the progression of time and shifting societal perspectives.
